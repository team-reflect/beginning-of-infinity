title: The Beginning of Infinity
---

The [[Beginning of Infinity]] contains a hopeful message for humanity. [[David Deutsch]] describes the process through which our species has emerged from a dirt-scratching purgatory to today's towering technological heights. 

Deutsche shows that, if we choose, no problem is beyond us. With the right [[Knowledge]] we can have a cosmically-sized impact upon our universe. We are limited solely by the laws of nature. We are but at the start of a road to infinity. 

These are some short cliff-notes on the book, but we encourage you to [buy and read the real thing](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359).

We have made virtually no [[Progress]] over the vast majority of human history. Only recently (mostly since the European [[Enlightenment]]) has progress been discernible inside a human lifetime.

The [[Enlightenment]] showed us progress is both achievable and desirable. It instituted a culture of [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]], the two key components for any kind of rapid progress across any discipline from [[Science]] to [[Morality]].

[[Science]] is the practice of finding good [[Explanation]]s, statements about what is there, what it does, and how and why. [[Morality]] is about the problem of what to do next and, more generally, what sort of life to lead, and what sort of world to want. Both are explanatory, rational, and objective.

[[Good Explanation]]s objectively differ from [[Bad Explanation]]s because they are [[Hard to vary]]. Explanations are inherently error prone (see [[Fallibilism]]) which is why we need [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]. Explanations can have unbounded [[Reach]] (i.e. apply to solve unforeseen problems).

TODO - universality 

Once those explanations are recorded somewhere, (such as on papyrus scrolls, DNA strands, hard-disks) they become [[Knowledge]]. There are only two known processes of creating [[Knowledge]]: thoughts of [[People]] and biological [[Evolution]]. They have some key differences (e.g. speed of replication, iteration, and progress).

[[Explanation]]s are a form of information, and information can only be processed in basically one way, with [[Universal Computation]] of the kind invented by Babbage and Turing.

All [[Problems]] can be solved with the right [[Explanation]]s limited only by the laws of nature. However the search for [[Explanation]]s will create new problems. Hence problems are inevitable.

Both the [[Principle of Mediocrity]] (we are nothing special in this universe) and [[Spaceship Earth]] (Earth provides the ideal environment for us) are mistaken. Earth no more provides us with a life-support system than it supplies us with radio telescopes. And [[People]], as [[Universal Explainers]], can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe.

[[Knowledge]] creating entities (aka [[People]]) can exist almost anywhere in the universe. With the right knowledge [[People]] could feasible create an ideally suited environment in an empty area of space (by hoovering up and transmuting hydrogen atoms into a space-station).

[[Technology]], once created, is automatic. Once the technology exists we will not have to think about about vacuums or surviving in space (the same way you don't think about your house's insulation).

Biological [[Evolution]] was a precursor to the main story of evolution, the unbounded evolution of [[Memes]]: ideas that cause themselves to replicate (aka [[Replicators]]). In many ways memes are analogous to genes, but there are also profound differences in the way they evolve. A collection of [[Memes]] forms a [[Culture]].

Think of [[Memes]] as any ideas that are passed between lots of people. For example, a language, scientific theory, or religious belief are all memes. Memes have to be actively replicated to survive (i.e. spoken or written and distributed). A [[Rational Meme]] is a [[Good Explanation]] that relies on the recipient's critical faculties to cause itself to be replicated. An [[Anti-rational Meme]] is a [[Bad Explanation]] and invariably relies on hijacking base emotions for replication (tapping into fear or anger).

Deustsch defines [[Optimism]] as the theory that all failures are due to lack of [[Knowledge]]. That doesn't mean proceeding as if there won't be bad outcomes (since problems are inevitable) - he calls that [[Blind Optimism]]. In contrast [[Blind Pessimism]] is avoiding everything not known to be safe.

[[Dynamic Societies]] tend towards [[Optimism]] and [[Rational Meme]]s. Because they embody the principles of the [[Enlightenment]] they make rapid progress. [[Static Societies]] fear change, are dominated by [[Anti-rational Meme]]s, and stifle [[Conjecture]] and [[Criticism]].

There are no mathematically provably fair forms of [[Governing]] and therefore the most important aspect to get right is to be able to remove leaders (see [[Criticism]] and [[Error Correction]]) when necessary.

We should not use (the semblance of) [[Sustainability]] as an aspiration or a constraint on planning. For example, we shouldn't just try and solve the 'human' part of global warming. If the earth goes into a new ice-age, or warms dangerously, we should solve that regardless of how much of it is man-made or not.

Humanity was never sustainable. It is a myth that there ever was a time of tranquility where we lived peacefully at one with nature and each other. Just open any history book or talk to any archaeologist. Human life was brutal until very recently. And eventually we will be wiped out by an extinction event (ice age, meteor, supernova, gamma ray burst), unless we choose otherwise and create the [[Knowledge]] to save us.

Since all problems can be solved with the right [[Knowledge]] and we humans, as [[Universal Explainers]], have the potential to obtain any knowledge, we can have a cosmically sized impact upon the universe. Not only can we survive, but we can explore, learn, and thrive throughout our galaxy and more. If we so choose.
